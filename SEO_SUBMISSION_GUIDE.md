# Professional SEO Submission Guide for pratikpaneru.com.np

Now that your website code is optimized, you must explicitly tell search engines that your site exists. Search engines will eventually find you, but these steps make it happen **immediately**.

## Phase 1: Google Search Console (Critical)
**Market Share:** ~92% (Google)

1.  **Go to:** [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome)
2.  **Login:** Use your Google Account.
3.  **Add Property:**
    *   Select **"URL prefix"** on the right side.
    *   Enter: `https://pratikpaneru.com.np`
    *   Click **Continue**.
4.  **Verify Ownership (The HTML File Method is Easiest):**
    *   Google will ask you to download an HTML file (e.g., `google123456789.html`).
    *   **ACTION:** Download that file and tell me the **filename** and **content**. I will save it to your folder.
    *   Once I save it, click **Verify** on the Google page.
5.  **Submit Sitemap:**
    *   In the GSC dashboard menu, click **Sitemaps**.
    *   Enter `sitemap.xml` in the box.
    *   Click **Submit**.
    *   *Result:* Google now knows every page on your site.

## Phase 2: Bing Webmaster Tools
**Covers:** Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, ChatGPT Search.

1.  **Go to:** [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)
2.  **Sign In:** You can use your Google or Microsoft account.
3.  **Import:** The easiest way is to click **"Import"** from Google Search Console (after you finish Phase 1).
    *   This automatically pulls your verification and sitemap.
    *   *Result:* You are instantly indexed on Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo.

## Phase 3: Brave Search
**Covers:** Brave Browser, Brave Search.

2.  Brave creates its own independent index. You can manually submit your URL here if it's not appearing:
    *   [Submit Link to Brave](https://search.brave.com/index)

## Phase 4: Social Signals (The "Growth Hack")
Search engines trust websites that are talked about.
1.  **Create a Twitter/X Account:** Share your articles. Grok will pick this up immediately.
2.  **LinkedIn:** Add your website link to your profile under "Contact Info" and "Experience".
3.  **GitHub:** If you have code, link your website on your GitHub profile.

## Maintenance
*   **Check GSC Weekly:** Look for "Coverage Errors".
*   **Updates:** When you add a new post, the `sitemap.xml` is static currently. You might need to manually inspect/request indexing in GSC for new URLs until we automate the sitemap updating.
